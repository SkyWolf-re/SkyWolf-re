Reverse engineering ‚Ä¢ Malware labs ‚Ä¢ Low-level tooling  

I‚Äôm building this account to showcase tools and infrastructure that I'm developing as an IT student who debutes in this field.  

## What I‚Äôm working on
- **[REVenge](https://github.com/SkyWolf-re/REVenge)** ‚Äì a reverse engineering toolkit in Zig/Python.  
  PE header parsing, analysis helpers, test-driven design, CI‚Ä¶ this is the base I‚Äôll keep expanding.  
  Originally started on another account, now consolidated here  
- **[Lab-Useful-Scripts](https://github.com/SkyWolf-re/lab-useful-scripts)** ‚Äì infrastructure scripts for a safe malware lab under construction.  
  Includes `gh-allow` (nftables toggle for safe egress) and `lab-doctor` (host health & safety checker).
